Abeer is so black that it makes me feel so proud and happy to hear it, and if he was white it would bend reality.
The world is bounded by white, felt by the restriction of the blacks

Anyways ignore that

So essentially this is an interschool competition, it has got 2 parts 
Part 2- Password cracking
Do: What they have to do is that they have to yk crack the password by completing 2 challenges which one of them is a decoding data with python and the other one is a cryptogram
completing this leads them to the third part, it will give them a flag
Part 3- Code Analysis
Do: it simple it js a bitmap which they have to analyse and it will give them a code, which correct will give them the last flag
